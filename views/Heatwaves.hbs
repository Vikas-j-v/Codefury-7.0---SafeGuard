    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>What is a Heat Wave?</h2>
        <p>A Heat Wave is a period of abnormally high temperatures, more than the normal maximum temperature that occurs
            during the summer season in the North-Western parts of India. Heat Waves typically occur between March and
            June, and in some rare cases even extend till July. The extreme temperatures and resultant atmospheric
            conditions adversely affect people living in these regions as they cause physiological stress, sometimes
            resulting in death.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="imd-criteria">
        <h2>IMD Criteria for Heat Waves</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat Wave need not be considered till the maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40°C for
                plains and at least 30°C for hilly regions.</li>
            <li>For stations with normal maximum temperatures ≤ 40°C: Heat Wave is declared with a temperature departure
                of 5°C to 6°C, and Severe Heat Wave with a departure of 7°C or more.</li>
            <li>For stations with normal maximum temperatures > 40°C: Heat Wave is declared with a departure of 4°C to
                5°C, and Severe Heat Wave with a departure of 6°C or more.</li>
            <li>If the actual maximum temperature remains 45°C or more, heat waves should be declared regardless of
                normal maximum temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Higher daily peak temperatures and longer, more intense heat waves are becoming increasingly frequent
            globally due to climate change. India too is feeling the impact of climate change in terms of increased
            instances of heat waves which are more intense in nature with each passing year, and have a devastating
            impact on human health thereby increasing the number of heat wave casualties.</p>

    <section id="health-impacts">
        <h2>Health Impacts of Heat Waves</h2>
        <p>The health impacts of Heat Waves typically involve dehydration, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and/or heat
            stroke. The signs and symptoms are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heat Cramps:</strong> Edema (swelling) and Syncope (fainting) generally accompanied by fever
                below 39°C i.e. 102°F.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Exhaustion:</strong> Fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle
                cramps, and sweating.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat Stroke:</strong> Body temperatures of 40°C i.e. 104°F or more along with delirium, seizures
                or coma. This is a potential fatal condition.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="acclimatisation">
        <h2>Acclimatisation</h2>
        <p>People at risk are those who have come from a cooler climate to a hot climate. Such individuals should not
            move about in open fields for a week until their bodies acclimatize to the heat. They should also drink
            plenty of water.</p>
        <p>Acclimatization is achieved by gradual exposure to the hot environment during a heat wave.</p>
